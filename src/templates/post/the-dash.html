    My favorite part of being a developer is making cool and useful stuff. While my

       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>last personal project</a> was fun to implement, I can't make myself
    believe that it's actually useful to anyone, even as a diversion. 
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing that I knew I <em>needed</em> to do before starting to work on any number of projects
    was to find a way to monitor any aplications that I was in charge of maintaining. This seemed
    like an excellent opportunity to polish up some skills by developing a dashboard that monitored
    that status of all of applications. Plus, this one could actually be useful!

<h4>Enter THE DASH</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    What I came up with was a simple project dashboard that I affectionately call THE DASH. You can
    find the full source code <a href='https://github.com/hughes-ch/the-dash'
                                 target='_blank'
                                 rel='noreferrer'
                                 class='underlined link'>here</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    THE DASH is a single page application developed with React and hosted with Netlify. It's
    completely serverless, leveraging Netlify's Function feature and AWS Lambda. Website statuses
    are stored in AWS's DynamoDB and user credentials are managed through AWS Cognito. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The user experience is pretty straightforward. They are first shown a public screen with a
    description of the service and an option to login:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/the-dash-1.png") }}'
       class='light-border'
       alt='Picture of THE DASH public screen' />
  <p>
    Once the client selects the login button, they are navigated to AWS Cognito's hosted UI, where
    they enter their credentials. If the credentials are correct, Cognito routes the client back to
    the Dashboard page along with an API token. If the Dashboard can verify the API token, the
    client is shown the Dashboard:
  </p>
  <video autoplay loop muted>
    <source src='https://static.chrishughesdev.com/the-dash-3.webm'
            type="video/webm">
      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
  </video>
  <p>
    From the Dashboard, the user can see any ongoing alarms, a detailed overview, and detailed
    status for each web application. They also have controls to refresh, add and delete
    applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When a client isn't actively using THE DASH, it still monitors application status through AWS
    Lambdas scheduled at regular intervals. If something is determined to be down, an email is
    sent to users through AWS SES. That way, users can always be sure that their web applications
    are working, even if they are not logged into THE DASH.
