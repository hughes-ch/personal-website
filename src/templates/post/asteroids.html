This blog post is about a neat little personal project that I did to sharpen my Javascript skills -
the classic game of Asteroids!

  <p>
    Having just made the crazy leap from my full-time job to full-time freelancing, I've been
    scrambling to sharpen as many skills as I can. Since I already knew that it was going to be a
    grind, I wanted my projects to bring me joy, even ones I could finish in a week.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my favorite projects in college was to implement the classic game of Asteroids using a
    SoC which had a built-in FPGA HDMA driver. You can actually still find the code on my github.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were <em>supposed to</em> hook in a gyroscope so users could control the ship by
    tilting the board. Then, they could use the buttons on the PCB to shoot/thrust. Well, we never
    got the gyroscope working, but it still turned out OK.
  </p>
  <p>
    I decided to relive my college years, but this time create the game in Javascript so it could be
    played in the browser instead of needing the SoC. And of course, I was going to hook in the
    gyroscope...
  </p>
  <p>
    The completed game can be found at <a href='https://asteroids.chrishughesdev.com/'
                                          target='_blank'
                                          rel='noreferrer'
                                          class='underlined link'>asteroids.chrishughesdev.com</a>.
  </p>
  <a href='https://asteroids.chrishughesdev.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
    <img src={{ url_for('static', filename='img/asteroids-3.png') }} alt='Asteroids Logo'/>    
  </a>
  <p>
    The directions to play are on the top of the home screen. If you're on desktop, W, A, and D
    control the ship movements (or arrow keys if you prefer), and the space bar shoots.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fun part is playing on mobile. In that case, the game uses the gyroscope on the mobile phone
    to steer the craft. Tapping on the right side of the screen shoots and tapping on the left
    controls the thruster.

<h4>Technologies</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    The app is created with <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/'
                               target='_blank'
                               rel='noreferrer'
                               class='underlined link'>Python's Flask framework</a> managing the
    backend and plain-old Javascript in the frontend. The HTML is actually really simple. It just
    ended up being a huge <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp'
                             target='_blank'
                             rel='noreferrer'
                             class='underlined link'>HTML5 canvas element</a> that takes the entire
    screen. Then I used Javascript to render the required graphics directly on the canvas. One
    of the reasons that I went with the game of Asteroids is because the graphics are really simple,
    yet it still makes a game which is satisfying to code and play. For this exercise, I just wanted
    to sharpen my skills in responsive apps, not spend all my time making beautiful graphics. I knew
    once I went down that rabbit hole, I would never come out. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways, even though the game was "plain-old Javascript," I still needed a unit testing package,
    a somewhat more advanced math package, and a package to calculate collisions for me. Instead of
    implementing these myself, I used <a href='https://yarnpkg.com/'
                                         target='_blank'
                                         rel='noreferrer'
                                         class='underlined link'>Yarn</a> to handle the package
    management for me. I used <a href='https://webpack.js.org/'
                                 target='_blank'
                                 rel='noreferrer'
                                 class='underlined link'>Webpack</a> to bundle this stuff together
    and deliver it to the client.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those curious, the packages I relied on most were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href='https://jestjs.io/'
         target='_blank'
         rel='noreferrer'
         class='underlined link'>Jest</a> for testing
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://mathjs.org/'
         target='_blank'
         rel='noreferrer'
         class='underlined link'>Mathjs</a> for matrix math
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/earcut'
         target='_blank'
         rel='noreferrer'
         class='underlined link'>Earcut</a> for collision detection
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      The site (both front and backend) is hosted on Heroku. If you noticed that the initial load 
      is a little long, it's because I'm on the
      <a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours'
         target='_blank'
         rel='noreferrer'
         class='underlined link'>free tier</a>. To save money and push users to use their paid
      tiers, Heroku actually puts their free tier servers to sleep if they have not received a
      request in a certain period of time. On the first request after a period of inactivity,
      it can take several seconds for the server to re-activate. Not ideal, but the fact that they
      provide a platform where I can just push to Github and they handle all the setup and load
      balancing for free is already too good to be true, so I can't complain.

<h4>Features and Gameplay</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    The game starts at the main menu, where the only choice the user has is to proceed. If you're
    on mobile, the first tap will prompt if you wish to allow the website to access motion and
    orientation. Once you get past the prompt, you'll get to access the rest of the game unimpeded.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the main menu, you'll be dropped into the classic game of asteroids.
  </p>
  <img src={{ url_for('static', filename='img/asteroids-1.png') }} alt='Asteroids gameplay'/>
  <p>I tried to follow the
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)#gameplay'
       target='_blank'
       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>classic gameplay</a> as much as I could, including adding alien
    saucers which try to shoot at the player. I ignored some of the later-stage dynamics since I
    would have never seen them live. I haven't been able to get past the first few stages...
  </p>
  <p>
    After losing all of your lives to asteroids or saucers, the game switches to the High Score
    screen. 
  </p>
  <img src={{ url_for('static', filename='img/asteroids-2.png') }}
       alt='High score screen displayed after losing'/>
  <p>
    Here, you are free to enter all of your highest scores along with any memorable names you can
    think of. The entries persist until the Heroku free tier runs out of database storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing to note is that everyone gets their own set of high scores, so the entries are there
    for your own enjoyment.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you enter a high score, the new high score will be displayed if the server
    successfully processed it. Then within a few moments, you will be brought back to the home
    screen. If you don't want to enter a score, you can press Enter (or Done if you're on mobile)
    without entering anything into the form, and you'll also be redirected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game should have the same feel whether you are on your laptop or on mobile. I made sure to
    scale everything depending on the screen size and device pixel ratio. Even if you change the
    orientation of your phone mid-game (portrait to landscape or vice-versa), the game should be
    re-rendered in a way that's expected and doesn't harm gameplay.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Like all my other recent work, the Asteroids project
    <a href='https://github.com/hughes-ch/asteroids'
       target='_blank',
       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>can be found on Github</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though Asteroids feels like a silly project, it was a blast to implement and I learned a ton
    while doing so. Games have a way of exposing any weakness in a design and gotchas with languages
    you might not be that familiar with. Plus, getting this to work well on mobile took quite a bit
    of fiddling... Well, on to my next project where I can continue to sharpen my Javascript skills!
  </p>
  <p>
    My best score is only about 1080. See if you can beat it!
