<h4>Adding New Posts</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    My choice for adding a new blog post is really simple. I just add a new HTML template somewhere
    where Flask knows to look for it. Then Flask renders the blog post just like any other page.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, this might not sound that user-friendly since I essentially have to write code each
    time I want to add a blog post. But my alternatives would be to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a markup language like the one used for Github's READMEs or Wiki articles</li>
    <li>Implement a rich text editor in a separate Admin screen in my blog</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In both cases, I would need to implement some sort of blog post rendering feature beyond what's
    already being provided by the browser and Jinja. I couldn't convince myself that I would be able
    to add a feature that wasn't already available with HTML (a markup language in itself). In the
    second case, I'd also need to create a dynamic Admin screen with a login feature, a database,
    and a non-trivial user input in the rich text editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since my other options didn't seem like great alternatives, I went basic and just stuck to plain
    HTML. It also gives the added benefit of being version controlled (instead of being stuck in a
    database) and editable with Emacs (objectively the best text editor).
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Accessing Posts</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Serving the post contents with HTML templates is also easy. I can essentially route the URI
    matching the post name to the rendered HTML template contents with Flask. If I ended up using
    an Admin screen and database to store files, it would require a database lookup. 
  </p>
  <p>
    One huge downside with the HTML template method is accessing metadata about the posts. I first
    ran into this problem when trying to implement SEO for the website. Search engines need a lot
    of data about each post including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Author</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Post contents</li>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>URL</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Due to how Flask/Jinja's HTML templates are defined, the code that renders the HTML (which
    contains the SEO content) is pretty much decoupled from the content in the
    template. The rendering code only knows the template location, not the actual contents of 
    the template. However, I had to somehow get access to the rendered blog post contents
    <em>before</em> rendering the rest of the page. 
  </p>
  <p>
    What I came up with isn't great, and it can probably still be improved upon. If someone is
    considering taking my lazy approach of using HTML templates for posts instead of using a
    database, they'll have to keep this in mind if they'll need the post metadata.
  </p>
  <p>
    My solution is to load all of the blog posts at startup, render them, and then parse the
    metadata and blog post contents into a container called the PostList. Afterwards, the PostList
    can be referenced by the code serving up the HTML if it needs access to any metadata or contents
    of a blog post. The actual posts in the container are sorted by date, which is convenient for
    rendering those pages which are time-ordered like the Archive and the index page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the PostList is in the template context, accessing the information within is pretty simple.
    Here's a snippet of the Archive template as it renders the list of titles and dates from the
    PostList:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
{% for post in post_list %}
<div>
<a href='{{ post.full_url }}/'>
  <p>{{ post.datestr }}</p>
  <p>{{ post.title }}</p>
</a>
</div>
{% endfor %}
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    In this example, {{ codeify('post_list') }} is the PostList in template context. What this loop
    does is create a link to each posts with the post's title and date as the text within the link.
    Then the client can see a short listing of all posts without having to also comb through the
    content. If the Archive page still needed the contents for some reason, the rendered contents of
    the post can be accessed just as easily through the {{ codeify('contents') }} attribute.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the interface is simple, what I don't like about this solution is that I have to render
    and parse HTML templates <em>before</em> serving the same HTML templates to the client. The
    redundancy can really slow down processing since it needs to handle so much information between
    requests. This is most noticeable during unit tests, where the PostList needs to be regenerated
    for each test, sometimes several times.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to take a look at my Github, the code I've been referencing is
    <a href='https://github.com/hughes-ch/personal-website/blob/main/src/postlist.py'
       target='_blank'
       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this was done with a database, the contents of the template wouldn't have to be rendered
    until it was served to the client. Then it would be up to the user to enter the metadata when
    they created the post. In most cases that I could imagine, the content would be served much
    faster at little cost to the maintainer of the blog (at least after they initially set up the
    database and Admin screen). 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's up to you which approach you go with. If I were to do it again, I'd still stick with the
    plain HTML. However, I'd probably figure out a way to load the posts once at the beginning of
    unit testing and then never again to improve testing speed. I'll go into why the slow-ness isn't
    a factor on the deployed website in my next post about deployment.

<h4>Syntax Highlighting</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    One of my biggest motivating factors to implement my website in Flask instead of using a
    drag-and-drop website builder was to have more control over the syntax highlighting in the code
    in my blog posts. To get the syntax highlighting I always dreamed of, I used the Python
    <a href='https://pygments.org/'
       target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>pygments module</a>.
    This was actually surprisingly easy to set up and works great. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To get it working, first install with:
  </p>
  {{ codeify("
$ pip install pygments
  ", lang='bash') }}
  <p>
    A quick test in the console will show how it will convert a simple {{ codeify('hello world!') }}
    function into HTML:
  </p>
  {{ codeify("
>>> import pygments
>>> import pygments.formatters
>>> import pygments.lexers
>>> pygments.highlight('print(\"hello world!\")',
...     pygments.lexers.PythonLexer(),
...     pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter())

'<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;hello world!&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n'
", lang='pycon') }}
  <p>
    The {{ codeify('pygments.highlight()') }} method is doing all the work here. The first
    parameter is the code block to highlight. In this example, we're simply printing
    {{ codeify('print("hello world!")') }}.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second parameter is what's called a "lexer." This is how pygments knows which words and
    symbols to highlight. Pygments provides 
    <a href='https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/' 
       target='_blank' 
       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>a ton of lexers to choose from</a> including HTML, Python, CSS, and
    many others. In this example, I've chosen Python so that {{ codeify('print') }} will be
    recognized as a keyword.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third parameter is known as a "formatter". This lets pygments know how to output the
    highlighted code. <a href='https://pygments.org/docs/formatters/'
                         target='_blank'
                         rel='noreferrer'
                         class='underlined link'>Pygments doesn't provide quite as many formatters</a>, 
    and the only ones that were useful to me were the NullFormatter (for plain text) and the 
    HtmlFormatter. However, the HtmlFormatter takes arguments which allow you to specify how the
    output code should be formatted, like whether to include line numbers. In this example, I've
    chosen to output the code as plain HTML without line numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The {{ codeify('pygments.highlight()') }} method will only provide us use if we can somehow pass
    code from the HTML templates to the {{ codeify('pygments.highlight()') }} method. Luckily, Flask
    provides a way through 
    <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/templating/#context-processors' 
       target='_blank' 
       rel='noreferrer'
       class='underlined link'>context processors</a>. These are functions which run before a
    template is rendered and inject new variables into the template context. They do so by
    returning a dict populated with the new variables. Each key is the variable in the template
    context, while the value is from the app context. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
@app.context_processor
def inject_title():
    return dict(title='My Awesome Webpage')
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    This would set each instance of {{ codeify('{{ title }}') }} in the Jinja HTML template to
    {{ codeify('My Awesome Webpage') }}. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Python handles all variables as objects (including functions), there's no reason that
    we can't inject a function as a context processor the same way!
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of calling {{ codeify('pygments.highlight()') }} directly, I created a wrapper function
    called {{ codeify('_codeify()') }} which does some pre/post processing before delegating to 
    pygments like removing whitespace. I've provided this as a context processor to Flask. I'll show
    an example of how that works in a bit. First, I'd like to explain {{ codeify('_codeify') }}.
  </p>
  <p> 
    One of the most important things my {{ codeify('_codeify') }} method does is to notify Flask
    that the code is "safe" and that it can be rendered as markup. By default, Flask escapes all
    dynamically rendered markup. Not doing so could be a huge security risk by allowing user's to
    inject potentially malicious code. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, I chose to use the {{ codeify('flask.Markup()') }} mechanism to mark my code as
    safe. My {{ codeify('_codeify()') }} method ends up looking like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
def _codeify(self, code):
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    formatted_code = code.strip()

    # Syntax highlight
    formatted_code = pygments.highlight(
        code,
        pygments.lexers.PythonLexer(),
        pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter())

    # Return code as Markup
    return flask.Markup(f'<code>{formatted_code}</code>')
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    I also found it useful to add a third parameter to {{ codeify('_codeify') }} to allow specifying
    a language. Then I could dynamically select from a dict of lexers and formatters using the
    language name as a key. Here's an abbreviated version of my {{ codeify('_lang_config') }} dict:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
self._lang_config = {
    'default': {
        'lexer': pygments.lexers.TextLexer(),
        'formatter': pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter(
            wrapcode=True)
    },
    'py': {
        'lexer': pygments.lexers.PythonLexer(),
        'formatter': pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter(
            linenos=True,
            wrapcode=True)
    },
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Then it could be integrated into the previous example like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
def _codeify(self, code, lang=None):
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    formatted_code = code.strip()

    # Syntax highlight
    fallback_config = self._lang_config['default']
    formatted_code = pygments.highlight(
        code,
        self._lang_config.get(lang, fallback_config)['lexer'],
        self._lang_config.get(lang, fallback_config)['formatter'])

    # Return code as Markup
    return flask.Markup(f'<code>{formatted_code}</code>')
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Note how I used {{ codeify('dict.get()') }} instead of the
    {{ codeify('[]') }} operator so that I could fall back to a default config if a language
    was not specified. In this case, my default configuration was to use a TextLexer, which
    didn't add any highlighting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the second entry of my {{ codeify('_lang_config') }} dict, you'll see that the
    HtmlFormatter I used for Python has {{ codeify('wrapcode') }} and {{ codeify('linenos') }}
    set to true. The {{ codeify('wrapcode') }} parameter is needed to meet HTML5 specifications
    for wrapping code in {{ codeify('<pre>') }} and {{ codeify('<code>') }} blocks. The 
    {{ codeify('linenos') }} parameter specifies that line numbers should be added to the block.
  </p>
  <p>
    An interesting note is that pygments structures the line numbers as a table, but not in the
    way you would think. In order to allow easy copy/pasting of code, the table is actually two
    columns and only one row. Separate lines are only separated by a newline element, not a new
    table row. That means that the numbers and code need to be using the same text size and font
    or they will be misaligned. In my case, my table content was also centered vertically, which
    caused an unexpected misalignment. Keep this quirk in mind as you are developing your page
    stylesheet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of stylesheets, <a href='https://pygments.org/docs/quickstart/#command-line-usage'
                                target='_blank'
                                rel='noreferrer'
                                class='underlined link'>the pygments quickstart page</a> provides
    a way to generate a stylesheet that can be used with any pygment-ized HTML. Just execute this
    on the command line after installing pygments:
  </p>
{{ codeify('
$ pygmentize -S default -f html > pygments.css
', lang='bash') }}
  <p>
    Then include the stylesheet in the head of your HTML along with the rest of the stylesheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Putting it all together, first define a method which returns the markup which should be
    injected into the page:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
def _codeify(self, code, lang=None):
    # Contents abbreviated - see above for full example
    return flask.Markup(code)
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Then notify the Jinja template engine of the new method by declaring it a context processor:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
@app.context_processor
def add_context_processors():
    return dict(codeify=self._codeify)
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Then use your new method by calling it within a Jinja template, making sure to include the
    pygments stylesheet:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <title>Python print method - example usage</title>
    <link href='pygments.css' rel='stylesheet' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Example usage of print</h1>
    {{ codeify('print(\"Hello world!\")', lang='py') }}
  </body>
</html>
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    And with that, you'll have syntax highlighting on your page!
  </p>

  <p>
    This post covered a lot, including much of the actual Python that went into this project. I hope
    anyone who is doing a similar project in the future can take some of the lessons learned from this
    one to accelerate their project forward by either avoiding some of the pitfalls of the choices I
    made or building on them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time, I'd like to cover deployment to Netlify. See you then!
