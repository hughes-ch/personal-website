  In this blog post, I'd like to cover some of the HTML/CSS choices that I made. This has been a
  iterative process, and I'm sure after I publish this post I'll make adjustments (maybe even during
  this post as I explain my rationale). If you look at the commit history, you can see I've come a
  long way from the first static HTML page, and what Flask now serves.
</p>
<h4>Semantic, Tidy HTML</h4>
<p>
  I try to design code that is maintainable and easy to understand so that I (or someone else) can
  pick it up a year from now and still understand what I did. Therefore I try to stick to as many
  of the <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp' class='underlined link'>
    recommended HTML styles and best practices
  </a>
  as I can, and use
  <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp' class='underlined link'>
    semantic HTML
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  A lot of these things are pretty easy, and I just had to remember to check them off as I was
  writing the HTML. Things like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declaring the document type (the {{ codeify("<!DOCTYPE html>") }} at the top of a page)</li>
  <li>
    Avoiding long code lines -
    I tried to keep mine under 100 characters unless dynamically rendered
  </li>
  <li>
    Including the {{ codeify("<title>") }} tag. Plus, the title adds a cool phrase to the tab which
    is holding the site, like {{ settings['Render']['BlogTitle'] }}.
  </li>
  <li>Setting
<ol>
  <li>Correct structure (html, body, head)</li>
  <li>Add lang attribute</li>
  <li>Charset</li>
  <li>Setting viewport</li>
</ol>
<h4>So meta</h4>
<h4>Favicon</h4>
<h4>What are OG?</h4>
<h4>Stylesheets, bro</h4>
