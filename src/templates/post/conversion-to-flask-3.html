<h3><a href='{{ post_url }}' class='link'>Implementing my Website in Flask - Part 3</a></h3>
<p class='post-caption' id='date'>Oct 21, 2021</p>
<p>
  Check out <a href='{{url_for("blog_post", name="conversion-to-flask-2") }}' class='underlined link'>
    part 2 of this series</a> for an overview of the HTML and CSS which is being served to display
  the content on this webpage. As I stated there, you can also
  <a href='https://github.com/hughes-ch/personal-website' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>
    find the website source on Github</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I'd like to cover the basics of serving a website with Python, particularly its
  really lightweight
  <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>
    Flask framework</a>, which I've decided to use for this project. 
</p>
<p>
  In my search for the most well supported and well liked Python web frameworks, there were a few
  that always topped the chart. In the top three most popular on every tutorial I found were always
  Flask and Django. Flask is marketed as a fast, lightweight "micro" framework that provides just
  enough to be productive and then "gets out of your way." Django is marketed as "fully loaded" with
  features in order to handle data-driven websites.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to go with Flask because I knew my website would be simple. I didn't even expect to have
  a database, so Django seemed like overkill. I think I made the right decision, even if it was just
  so I wasn't overwhelmed learning all of the features of Django. 
</p>
<h4>The Basic Flask App</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    I was surprised at how little code is actually needed in order to get a simple app working:
  </p>
{{ codeify("  
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
    def index():
        return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Then you can run it from the command line like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
$ python hello.py
* Running on http://localhost:5000/
", lang='bash') }}
  <p>
    ... and that's it! 
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, {{ codeify("app") }} is the web application instance, created as an instantiation
    of Flask. Line 4 tells the app that any requests to relative URL "/" should be served the string
    {{ codeify("Hello World!") }}. Of course, this wouldn't include any style information or
    anything, but Flask does include a default 404 page if any other URLs are requested.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lines 8 and 9 just tell Flask to run the development server if the script is called directly
    (opposed to being imported as a module).
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Flask Templates</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    If you'd like to serve real HTML instead of simple strings, Flask provides a couple options, the
    most straightforward being the {{ codeify('render_template') }} method. Most of my URLs are
    handled this way. The basic usage looks like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("  
import flask
app = flask.Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
    def index():
        context = { 'content': 'Hello World!' }
        return flask.render_template('index.html', context)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    The first argument in {{ codeify('render_template') }} is the template Flask will use to render
    the content of the page (more on that in a second). The second variable is the 'context', or a
    dict of all the variables that should be available to the template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, there's no real benefit to throwing Python into the mix if a website is completely
    static and unchanging. In that case, its possible to just define the HTML and CSS to be
    standalone. But if the website is based on data that can change regularly, the HTML will need to
    be changed on the fly between requests based on the latest data. That's where Python comes in. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To dynamically render HTML, Flask is dependent on the
    <a href='https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>Jinja
      template engine</a> and its handy HTML templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jinja templates look really similar to HTML, just with some new Python-like syntax thrown in
    where content needs to be dynamically rendered. Here's an example for the hypothetical
    {{ codeify('Hello World') }} website from earlier:
  </p>
  {{ codeify("
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ content }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    The string between the {{ codeify('h1') }} tags on line 7 is actually referring to the
    {{ codeify('content') }} key of the {{ codeify('context') }} dict that was passed as the
    second argument to {{ codeify("render_template") }} in the previous example. Whatever value is
    stored for the {{ codeify('content') }} key (in this case, 'Hello World!') will be substituted
    between the {{ codeify('h1') }} tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jinja also provides syntax for conditionals and control flow. For example, if a block of HTML
    should be conditionally included, the {{ codeify('{% if %}') }} syntax can be used. An example
    from this website would be the Next/Prev page navigation links at the bottom of the index page.
    The code for the Next link looks like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
{% if next_page is none %}
  <span>Next</span>
{% else %}
  <a href='/page/{{ next_page }}/'>Next</a>
{% endif %}
  ", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    This example first checks if there's a valid next page of posts. If that's the case, the Next
    button is rendered as a link. If not, the Next button still looks the same, but it's rendered as
    a {{ codeify('span') }} so the user can't select it. 
  </p>
  <p> Jinja also provides more complex expressions to use in conditionals. For the complete list,
    <a href='https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#expressions'
       target='_blank'
       class='underlined link'>see the documentation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along with conditionals, Jinja also provides loops. They use a very similar syntax to Python
    loops. Just like conditionals, they are specified within {{ codeify('{% %}') }} blocks. An
    example from this blog is again from the index page, where I show the latest blog posts:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
{% for post in posts %}
  <article>
    {{ post }}
  </article>
  <hr>
{% endfor %}
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    Jinja then repeats the pattern for each post that the Flask application provides to the template,
    wrapping each post in an {{ codeify('article') }} tag and adding a horizontal line underneath.
    This can be really helpful when maintaining repetitive pages. Instead of having to copy/paste
    multiple times, I can just specify the pattern once and Jinja repeats it for each iteration of
    the loop. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great feature of Jinja templates are their ability to extend other templates. For
    example, each one of my pages includes roughly the same information in the HTML head, the
    navigation area, and the footer. It would be a real pain to need to maintain them separately
    for each page. Instead, I can add these features once to a template called base.html:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
      <h1>{{ blog-title }}</h1>
      <p>{{ blog-caption }}</p>
      <div>
        <h3><a href='/about'>About Me</a></h3>
        <h3><a href='/archive'>Archive</a>
      </div>
    </nav>
    <main>
      {% block content %}
      {% endblock %}
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p><strong>{{ blog-title }}</strong></p>
      <p>Copyright © 2021 All Rights Reserved</p>
      <br/>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
", lang='html') }} 
  <p>
    Then any template can 'extend' this base template. The key here is the two lines on 16 and 17.
    This notifies Jinja that the {{ codeify('content') }} block has not been defined yet, and it should look for
    other templates which define {{ codeify('content') }}. Note that {{ codeify('content') }} is not
    a reserved word or anything. {{ codeify('{% block example %}') }} would work exactly the same,
    as long as another template actually defined what was in the {{ codeify('example') }} block.
  </p>
  <p>
    To define the {{ codeify('content') }} block, create another template called posts.html:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
{% extends '_base.html' %}
{% block content %}
  <h2>Latest Posts</h2>
  {% for post in posts %}
    <article>
      {{ post }}
    </article>
    <hr>
  {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    Now, the contents of each post will be substituted for {{ codeify("{% block content %}") }} in
    the rendered HTML any time {{ codeify('render_template') }} is called for posts.html.
  </p>
  <p>
    One last Jinja templates feature I found myself using a lot was the {{ codeify("{% include %}") }}
    tag. This substitutes the contents of the included template in place of the tag. This allows
    larger templates to be a composition of smaller, more modular ones. I found this particularly
    useful when adding the social media buttons to the header and footer. Since both use the same
    code, it made sense to just factor it out into its own template. Then it can be included into
    the footer like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
<footer>
  <p><strong>{{ blog-title }}</strong></p>
  <p>Copyright © 2021 All Rights Reserved</p>
  <br/>
  <p><strong>Want to get in touch?</strong></p>
  <div>
    {% include 'socialmedia.html' %}
  </div>
</footer>
", lang='html') }}
  <p>
    (Note the {{ codeify("{% include %}") }} on line 7)
  </p>
</section>
<h4>How I Chose My Templates</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Each of my page types are defined as a template, based off of the base template. For example,
    the 404 page, about page, archive page, etc all are their own templates. Then, any features
    that I found myself using in multiple places are defined as their own template to be
    {{ codeify('{% include %}') }}'ed. The actual blog posts are a special case and also designed
    to be {{ codeify('{% include %}') }}'ed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a picture describing the relationships between templates. Note the arrows pointing to
    the left are inheritance ({{ codeify("{% extends %}") }}). The arrows pointing to the right are
    composition ({{ codeify("{% include %}") }}).

<h4>Flask Design Patterns I Implemented</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    While the basic Flask app at the beginning of this post is impressive at how little code is
    actually needed, it isn't scalable, even for something as simple as a blog.
  </p>
  <p>
    I knew that the application would need multiple Python modules, so I followed what's called
    the <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/factory/'
           target='_blank'
           class='underlined link'>application factory design pattern</a>. This made it so that
    I wouldn't have to rely on access to a global variable in order to access my Flask instance.
    Instead, I could use the {{ codeify('flask.current_app') }} property to access my Flask
    instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This pattern also provides access to the {{ codeify('flask') }} command line tool. I could now
    run my app with the following commands:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
$ export FLASK_APP=src
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
", lang='bash') }}
  <p>
    I could also add further CLI tools for my app which could be accessed like {{ codeify('flask run') }}.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the 'build' tool (which I'll cover in a later blog post) can be defined with the
    following code:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
self.app = flask.Flask(__name__)
self.app.cli.add_command(cli.build)
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    ...and then accessed from the command line like this:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
$ export FLASK_APP=src
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask build
", lang='bash') }}  
  <p>
    My application factory didn't turn out exactly as the pattern specifies in the Flask
    documentation. I wanted to keep my application as object-oriented as possible, so my
    {{ codeify("__init__.py") }} looks like this, instead of containing the actual creation of the
    flask instance:
  </p>
{{ codeify('
def create_app():
    """ Create and configure blog app """
    config = Settings.instance()
    blog = Blog(config)
    return blog.app
', lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Then, my flask instance is created within the Blog class as {{ codeify('Blog.app') }}. Note that
    the {{ codeify("Settings.instance()") }} above is another module in my application which defines
    configurations like relative routes, the name of the blog, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The {{ codeify('Blog') }} constructor needs to look like this to provide {{ codeify('create_app') }}
    with the configured Flask instance:
  </p>
{{ codeify("  
  class Blog:

    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.app = flask.Flask(__name__)
        self.app.cli.add_command(cli.build)

        @self.app.route('/')
        def index():
...
", lang='py') }}        
  <p>
    Note that I elected to define all the routes within the {{ codeify('Blog') }} constructor. This
    is similar to the <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/factory/'
                         target='_blank'
                         class='underlined link'>application factory pattern</a> shown in the Flask
    tutorial, just with all of the Flask-specific stuff wrapped in my {{ codeify('Blog') }} class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike the simple Flask app at the beginning of this post, there are several URLs which need
    to be dynamically generated, like those associated with blog posts. In those cases, instead of
    using hard-coded routes, I used Flask's dynamic URL processing feature. These are specified in
    angle brackets, like the routes of the two methods below:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
@self.app.route('/')
@self.app.route('/page/<int:page>/')
def index(page=1):
    \"\"\" Creates the index page with latest blog posts \"\"\"
    pass
    
@self.app.route('/post/<name>/')
def blog_post(name=None):
    \"\"\" Creates a blog post page \"\"\"
    pass
", lang='py') }}      
  <p>
    This feature is really useful. In the case of the first method, it passes the value stored in
    {{ codeify('page') }} as the first parameter to the method. If a page is not specified (like in
    the default route {{ codeify('/') }}), the page will default to page 1. The {{ codeify('int') }}
    specifier before {{ codeify('page') }} tells Flask to only accept integer values here. If a
    string is passed instead, Flask will render the 404 page.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second method on line 7, the {{ codeify('name') }} parameter can be any string since
    there is no specifier in front. It is worth mentioning that Flask escapes these strings and
    does its best to ensure that there are no characters which may cause a security problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    In both examples, once Flask checks that the URL matches the template URL, it's up to my
    application to verify whether {{ codeify('page') }} is a valid page and {{ codeify('name') }} is
    a valid blog post.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since my blog is pretty simple, I didn't use many other advanced Flask design patterns that are
    mentioned in the documentation. One thing that I regret not implementing, though, is
    <a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/'
       target='_blank'
       class='underlined link'>
      Blueprints</a>. These provide a very modular approach that would have been easier to test and
    scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, I just stuck everything in my Blog class. Initially, this worked great. But as
    it (unexpectedly) grew, it became a little unwieldy. One thing that I noticed as well was that
    many of my routes were really similar and ended up sharing data, while others were completely
    distinct. These lines of shared data would have provided a great boundary to break certain
    features into new blueprints. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh well. If I find myself adding a new feature any time soon, I might roll in blueprints along
    with it...
  </p>
  <p>
    That covers everything that I wanted to cover in Flask! Next post, I'd like to discuss what went
    into actually building the context that Flask renders with each template.
  </p>
