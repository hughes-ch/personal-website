<h4>Introduction to Netlify</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Netlify is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider that markets themselves as a platform built for
    scale, where developers only have to worry about writing code. Instead of leaving it to the developer
    to manage webservers, set up a CI/CD pipelines, and handle scaling their service, Netlify seamlessly
    integrates into services like Github to automatically deploy to the cloud.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I'm currently working on a separate project where I decided to use a barebones AWS EC2 instance
    instead of a PaaS, I can confidently say that I'll be running back to a PaaS due to the seamless
    experience. Especially for small teams, it can save an incredible amount of time and provide the
    confidence that everything under the hood is working correctly. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As if the time savings weren't enough, Netlify provides a free tier of service which provides
    100GB of bandwidth, 300 build minutes, and one concurrent build per "team." I find that this is
    definitely enough for my site, since I'm the only developer on the team, and it's the only
    website. They also provide Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hosting a site is rediculously easy. First, you have to connect to a Git provider (Github in my
    case), then pick a repository, then set your site settings:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-1.webp") }}'
       alt='Settings page when initally hosting a repository on Netlify' />
  <p>
    I removed my repo and team name above since it would've confused things, but otherwise you can
    see how simple this page is. Just add your team name as the owner (you'll create a team when you
    set up an account), then select the branch to deploy in the repo. In this case, I have the main
    branch being deployed. Any time 'main' is updated, I get a notification from Netlify that a new
    build has started. Within a few minutes, the new version of the website is up. During the
    deployment, there's no downtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the really neat things is that Netlify will also provide staging deployments for all the
    other branches. It uses the same settings as provided for 'main' to build these branches. So if
    you make a change and would like to check them out before actually deploying it, Netlify will
    automatically set up that pipeline for you. When hooked up with a Github account, the preview
    will automatically start with any push to Github. You can easily access the previews from the
    pull request, where Netlify will add a comment:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-2.webp") }}'
       alt='Netlify preview on Github pull request page' />
  <p>
    Back to the settings page, to specify a base directory other than the root of your repo, you can
    set the 'Base directory' to a local directory in your repo. To use the root, leave the setting
    blank. The 'Build command' setting is any script that needs to run to set up the application.
    The 'Publish directory' is where the final static resources and scripts can be found in the
    built repo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under 'Advanced build settings', you can add environment variables and serverless functions.
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Serverless Architecture</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    On the topic of serverless functions, one of the things to keep in mind with Netlify is that it
    is a completely serverless architecture. It can serve static content, but any dynamic features
    (like API requests) must be defined solely with the
    <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/'
       target='_blank'
       class='underlined link'>function interface</a>. The Netlify service
    handles all of the incoming traffic and provides your function code with single events to
    process. It recommends making each function stateless and short lived. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A really basic example of a Javascript function from their website is the one below:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
exports.handler = async function(event, context) {  
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({message: 'Hello World'})
  };
}", lang='js') }}
  <p>
    In this example, {{ codeify('event') }} contains all of the information from the request, such
    as the method, headers, URL, and any data in the body of the request. According to the docs,
    {{ codeify('context') }} can have additional information about the client. Any request to this
    API endpoint immediately receives the friendly JSON response "Hello World." 
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest benefit to this serverless architecture is that developers don't need to worry about
    managing servers or managing a complex DevOps environment. However, it does take some
    restructuring for apps like mine which need access to the filesystem and run on top of a web
    server. The fact that functions need to be short lived means that things like Flask and Django
    are out of the question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, Netlify only accepts functions defined in Javascript and Go at the moment, so it looked
    like I was going to be out of luck. Bummer.
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Frozen-Flask Saves the Day</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Luckily for me, there's a way around the serverless architecture. Since my app doesn't use a
    database or have any dynamic features, it doesn't change between pushes to Github. As far as
    Netlify is concerned, it can be converted into a static website. My second stroke of luck was
    that Python has a module called
    <a href='https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>
      Frozen-Flask</a> that's designed to do just this. When a website is ready to be deployed, this
    module essentially traverses the entire sitemap, saving each rendered template into a static
    file soley containing HTML, XML, JSON, etc. From their website: "the result can be hosted
    without any server-side software."
  </p>
  <p>
    Sweet! No functions needed, just static hosting. Netlify can do that easily. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With Frozen-Flask, all of my local development is done in Python and Flask. Then on
    deployment, I just 'build' it - almost like compiled languages like C++. Instead of a binary
    output though, I get static assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Installation is really simple:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
$ pip install Frozen-Flask
", lang='bash') }}
  <p>
    Then you're ready to freeze your project!
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic example from their website is intended to be run as a standalone script which imports
    the Flask app instance and calls the {{ codeify('Freezer.freeze()') }} method on it:
  </p>
  {{ codeify("
from flask_frozen import Freezer
from myapplication import app

freezer = Freezer(app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    freezer.freeze()
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    In this case, {{ codeify('freezer.freeze()') }} traverses the URL structure of the
    application, dumping all of the static resources into the 'build' subdirectory of the current
    working directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this use case is OK, a more professional solution would be to incorporate Flask-Freeze
    into Flask's CLI. As we'll see later, it also makes deployment to Netlify a breeze.
  </p>
  <p>
    For some background, Flask uses the
    <a href='https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>
      Click project</a> to handle its command line interface. From its website, it markets itself
    as "a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces ... with as little code as
    necessary." I'm a fan of that.
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out adding new command line options certainly meet that promise. The previous example
    can be written with just a few extra lines of code:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
import flask

from click import command
from flask.cli import with_appcontext
from flask_frozen import Freezer

@command('build')
@with_appcontext
def build():
    freezer = Freezer(flask.current_app)
    freezer.freeze()
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Now we can access this functionality using {{ codeify("flask build") }} at the command line,
    just like we can use {{ codeify("flask run") }}. The first piece to make this work is using
    the {{ codeify("@command") }} decorator. This lets Click know that there will be a new command
    line argument, and that the {{ codeify('build()') }} function should be called to execute it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second piece is the {{ codeify('@with_appcontext') }} decorator. Unlike during requests,
    methods invoked through Flask's command line do not automatically get an application context
    pushed. This decorator notifies Flask to push a context so that the
    {{ codeify("flask.current_app") }} proxy is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also really important to note that the new CLI functions have to be registered with the
    Flask app at creation time. So wherever you create your app, you'll need to add these lines:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
from myCliModule import build
from myapplication import app  

app.cli.add_command(build)
", lang='py') }}
</section>
<h4>Some Caveats</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    This solution works great for most pages, but Frozen-Flask ran into a few issues:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It wasn't able to find dynamic URLs out of the box</li>
    <li>It didn't find my 404 page since it isn't associated with a URL</li>
    <li>It didn't provide an easy way to run it from the command line</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    First, let me dive into why my URLs weren't fully discovered...
  </p>
  <p>
    Frozen-Flask works sort of like a web crawler, using the Flask app definition as a site map. All
    of the statically defined routes are rendered and saved as static resources. Then, the dynamically
    created URLs are generated in a best-effort fashion. Like web crawlers need incoming links to
    discover a website, Frozen-Flask needs calls to {{ codeify('url_for') }} to act as an incoming
    link. If a page doesn't have incoming {{ codeify('url_for') }}s, you need to create
    <a href='https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/#url-generators'
       target='_blank'
       class='underlined link'>URL generators</a> to specify the full, valid URLs.
  </p>
  <p>
    One case where this showed itself was in my blog post URLs. Because of the way I have to
    pre-load them in Flask, an incoming {{ codeify('url_for') }} is never created for them.
    Frozen-Flask doesn't has no way to know about their existance. No big deal. To generate the
    URL for each post, I could use my
    <a href='{{url_for("blog_post", name="conversion-to-flask-4") }}'
       class='underlined link'>PostList from last blog post</a>. Since it stored the URL of each
    post, I could simply loop over it and yield each value:
  </p>
{{ codeify("  
def yield_blog_post_urls():
    for post in PostList():
        yield {'name': post.url}
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Note that "name" here is the input parameter to the dynamically generated URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, like the CLI functions, make sure to register the generators with the calling class. In
    this case, that's the freezer:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
freezer = Freezer(flask.current_app)
freezer.register_generator(yield_blog_post_urls)
freezer.freeze()
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    As another simple example, consider a pagination feature. The generator could simply loop over a
    range of numbers up to the maximum page value, yielding the page number as
    {{ codeify("{'page': num}") }}.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the URL generators hooked in, all of my dynamic URLs were turned into static resources as
    expected. But now I hit my second issue while using Frozen-Flask. Since my 404 page isn't tied
    to a URL, there's no way for Frozen-Flask to find it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution I came up with isn't really pretty, as Frozen-Flask doesn't offer support for this
    feature. After building all the pages that could be reached with a URL, I rendered the 404
    template and wrote it to a file in the same directory as the other files. Here's how it looks:
  </p>
{{ codeify("  
with app.test_request_context(base_url=None):
    write_path = pathlib.Path(freezer.root) / '404.html'
    with write_path.open('w') as f_handle:
        context = {
            'title': 'Oops! Page not found!',
        }

        f_handle.write(flask.render_template('_404.html', **context))
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    Note that the {{ codeify('test_request_context') }} is needed here to render the template.
    Without it, Flask doesn't know to push a request context and {{ codeify('flak.render_template') }}
    won't have the resources it needs to generate the template. This is the same procedure that
    Frozen-Flask uses under the hood to generate its static files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Great! Now to test this out...
  </p>
  <p>
    I elected to integrate this into the Flask CLI so that it would be just as easy to run the
    frozen version of the website as it was the regular version. Another benefit was that the code
    that ran the "standard" way (with {{ codeify('flask run') }} could be completely decoupled with
    this new way of running. I decided to call this new command {{ codeify('flask run-static') }}.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the reason why this effort is in the "caveats" section is because Frozen-Flask was designed
    to be run from the Python intepreter, not the Flask command line. Its {{ codeify('serve') }}
    method (which starts a local server and serves the newly built static resources) calls 
    {{ codeify("flask.current_app.run()") }} under the hood. Turns out Flask's CLI expressly forbids
    this. The command fails immediately with this warning:
  </p>
{{ codeify('
  /personal-website/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flask_frozen/__init__.py:397:
  Warning: Silently ignoring app.run() because the application is run from the flask command line executable.
  Consider putting app.run() behind an if __name__ == "__main__" guard to silence this warning.
  app.run(**options)
') }}
  <p>
    Instead of going back to the drawing board (as I probably should have), I decided to hack-and
    slash around this. I found that Flask checks the OS environment variable
    {{ codeify("FLASK_RUN_FROM_CLI") }} to determine if Flask was run from the command line. If
    {{ codeify("False") }}, Flask allows {{ codeify("app.run()") }} to execute as expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that caveat, our new command line interface to start a local static file server is
    really simple. Flask-Freeze does all the heavy lifting:
  </p>
{{ codeify("
@click.command('run-static')
@click.argument('host')
@flask.cli.with_appcontext
def run_static(host):
    os.environ['FLASK_RUN_FROM_CLI'] = 'false'
    self.freezer = flask_frozen.Freezer(flask.current_app)
    self.freezer.serve(host=host)
", lang='py') }}
  <p>
    The first line defines the command {{ codeify("run-static") }}. The second line defines a
    command line argument provides the caller to provide an address to host the server on
    (typically 0.0.0.0). The third decorator notifies Flask to run the method with
    app context so that {{ codeify("flask.current_app") }} is available to us. On line 5 is our
    environment variable hack, and on line 7 is the call to Frozen-Flask which tells it to start
    a local server that hosts our static files.
  </p>
  <p>
    With those few lines of code, Frozen-Flask serves the static website on our local machine, and
    everything looks the same as the dynamic website! Except since everything is already
    pre-rendered, everything is FAST!
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is a great intermediate step, the Frozen-Flask server isn't robust enough for hosting
    a web-facing application. So back to Netlify...
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Hooking Frozen-Flask into Netlify</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    For static websites, Netlify needs three build settings so that it knows how to deploy the site:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>The base directory</strong> - Serves as the working directory during the deployment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The publish directory</strong> - Serves as the website root where static content will
      be served from.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The build command</strong> - Renders static content and places output files into the
      publish directory.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The easiest way to specify these settings is through the Netlify UI. However, they also provide
    a way to <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/'
                target='_blank'
                class='underlined link'>configure projects through the use of a TOML file</a>. I
    just used the UI for my application.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you navigate to your site settings and select the 'Build & deploy' tab to the side of the
    page, you'll see the build settings for the website. I've highlighted them below:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-4.webp") }}'
       alt='Site settings page with build settings highlighted' />
  <p>
    You can see that I left the 'Base directory' setting as not set. This lets Netlify use its
    default setting which is to use the root of the Git repository. That works for this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, to stage everything in the 'Publish directory,' I've specified that Netlify should use the
    {{ codeify('flask build') }} command. Now, Netlify will pull all the source from Github and run
    {{ codeify('flask build') }} from the root of the repo. All that's left to do is to tell it to
    look in the right place for the HTML that it needs to serve. That's done with the 'Publish
    directory' setting on the third highlighted line. 
  <p>
    Alternatively, if you know the settings that you need beforehand, these settings are available
    to customize when creating a new site (see the image I posted way up at the top of the
    "Introduction to Netlify" section).
  </p>
</section>
<h4>Adding Custom DNS and HTTPS</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Netlify will host its web applications with its own domain names, using funny names like
    {{ codeify('zen-engelbart-f16ad6.netlify.app') }}. If you'd like to use a memorable name, you'll
    have to hook in your own domain name. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I used <a href='https://domains.google.com/' target='_blank' class='underlined link'>
      domains.google.com</a> to purchase my domain. Most are pretty cheap. For instance, this one
    was only $12 for the year. It's also possible to purchase DNS through Netlify if you know that
    the domain will always be hosted there.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use one of your own domains, first go to the "Domain management" tab in "Site Settings" in
    Netlify. There, you'll find the "Custom domains" box with the Netlify domain already listed:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-6.png") }}'
       alt='Domains settings page' />
  <p>
    Here, my own domain is already added in the second row. To add a new domain, select "Add domain
    alias" and enter the desired domain:
  </p>
  <div class='bordered-img-container'>
    <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-7.png") }}'
         alt='Entering a new domain alias'
         class='thin-pic'/>
  </div>
  <p>
    Netlify then instructs you to add a CNAME record pointing from your new domain to the Netlify
    domain (in this case, {{ codeify('zen-engelbart-f16ad6.netlify.app') }}). Note that if you don't
    do both steps (so that both sides are aware of the custom domain), you won't be able to access
    the application through your new domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    OK, those few steps were easy, but the easiest one is yet to come. Netlify is freakin' great in
    that it automatically handles setting up HTTPS for the application. At the bottom of the "Domain
    management" tab, you'll see this box:
  </p>
  <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-8.png") }}'
       alt='HTTPS settings in Netlify' />
  <p>
    Within about 15 minutes of getting your custom domain set up, Netlify will provision a TLS
    certificate from Let's Encrypt and your application will have HTTPS enabled. Even better, it
    renews it periodically so you never have to worry about it. Don't even have to press a button.
  </p>    
</section>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    With that, my website was available for all to see. With Netlify, I was able to get the speed of a
    static website while using the development power of a Python web development framework. Plus, I'm
    confident my app will be secure and available to whoever wants to look at it. I don't even need to
    manage anything besides my application software. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus, Netlify even offers shiny badges for your Github page!
  </p>
  <div class='bordered-img-container'>
    <img src='{{ url_for("static", filename="img/conversion-to-flask-5-5.svg") }}'
         alt='Netlify status badge example'
         class='thin-pic'/>
  </div>
  <p>
    ... and everyone knows that's what makes a good Github repo - how many status badges it has.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time, I'd like to cover one more topic about the blog, mostly because I haven't seen many
    good tutorials online. That topic is a shorter one - how to manually add RSS.
