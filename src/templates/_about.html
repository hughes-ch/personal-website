  <section>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Chris Hughes. When I'm sitting still, I'm a software engineer. Otherwise, I
      enjoy getting lost outdoors and competing in the crazy world of strength sports. I've lived
      in New England for nearly my entire life, and am currently residing in the beautiful state of
      New Hampshire. 
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <section>
      <p>
        I grew up curious, and I was always good at math and the sciences, but it wasn't actually until
        college that I started tinkering with code. At the time, I was a physics undergraduate at
        Northeastern University working as an intern under a professor. After getting my hands on an
        Arduino in the lab, I changed my course of study before I ever stepped foot in another physics
        class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before graduating, I had two more awesome internship experiences. The first was a small company
        called MC10 inc (now part of Medidata) and the second was at iRobot. In both of these roles, I
        worked with digital electronics and low-level software languages like C and C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found I really enjoyed the software side of things, so I set out after college to find a
        company where I could focus exclusively on software. I was eventually brought on by Raytheon
        (now RTX) as a software engineer. I stayed there for six years, working with development teams,
        integration teams, and even touching on DevOps. I left in 2021 as a senior software engineer.

  <h3>Current Work</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      My plan after leaving RTX was to freelance, but most of the technologies that I had
      been using weren't applicable to things that I could freelance. Actually, they weren't really
      applicable to anything outside of the defense and aerospace industry. But since I had the
      hankering to try something new, I figured I'd take a few months off to polish up my skills with
      open source and personal projects. You can find that work on my

  <h3>What I Can Offer</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      I just love making cool and useful stuff, and I'd be happy to do it in any language. But at
      this point in my career, I'm using Javascript (particularly Node and React), and Python
      (particularly Flask).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though my <em>favorite</em> part is the creation aspect, I think my biggest skill as a
      developer is finding the root cause of complex issues and distilling it into concrete,
      bite-sized steps that can be tackled individually. And from there, coming up with creative,
      robust solutions to each bite-sized piece. This was what I did for very large part
      of my time in the defense and aerospace world, and how I contribute to open-source projects.
