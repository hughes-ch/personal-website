<h2 class='page-title'>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hi, I'm Chris Hughes, a freelance web developer specializing in Python.</p>
  <p>I started my career with Raytheon Technologies after graduating from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Engineering.</p>
  <p>I spent five years at Raytheon, and was fortunate enough for some awesome experiences travelling, developing, integrating, and learning. My primary languages were C++, Perl, and MATLAB, though I troubleshot several more (including a proprietary language - Yikes!). Due to the incredible scale of the systems, I learned how to integrate massive, multi-process systems. I look forward to applying those skills in my career going forward.</p>
  <p>Now that I'm out of the defense and aerospace industry, I look forward to diving into cutting-edge software technologies. Though I'm new and self taught in the web development sphere, I'm constantly adding to my Python, Flask, and Django knowledge. I intend to contribute as a full-stack web developer to build fast, scalable web applications.</p>
  <p>For more information, check out my resume below:</p>

    Thanks for stopping by. If you'd like to get in contact, the best way is to use the social media links at the top or bottom of the page. I'm always learning, so if some of the content on the blog needs clarification, don't be hesitant to reach out.
